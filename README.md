# Hi there 👋

I'm **Enpei Zhang**, a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) 🌲, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yujun Yan](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/yujunyan/home).

Previously, I earned my B.S. in Information Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) 🔵.

## 🔍 Research

My research interests center on **AI agents** and **multi-agent systems**, with an emphasis on how agent interactions and workflow structures shape performance, efficiency, and reliability. Recently, I have focused on principled methods for automatic **agent workflow orchestration**, grounded in game theory and scheduling theory to improve efficiency and incentive alignment.

### Selected Publications

**Incentivizing inclusive contributions in model sharing markets**  
*Nature Communications, 2025*  
**Enpei Zhang**, Jingyi Chai, Rui Ye, Yanfeng Wang, Siheng Chen  
[Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62959-5)

Proposed iPFL, an incentive-compatible personalized federated learning framework that formulates federated training as a multi-agent market, enabling heterogeneous data holders to collaboratively train personalized models with formal guarantees of individual rationality and incentive compatibility, while achieving strong performance and economic utility across diverse training tasks including simple classification and LLM SFT.

**Judging with Many Minds: Do More Perspectives Mean Less Prejudice?**  
*EMNLP 2025*  
Chiyu Ma, **Enpei Zhang**, Yilun Zhao, Wenjun Liu, Yaning Jia, Peijun Qing, Lin Shi, Arman Cohan, Yujun Yan, Soroush Vosoughi  
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19477)

Conducted a systematic evaluation of bias behaviors in multi-agent LLM-as-Judge frameworks, modeling evaluation as an interactive multi-agent system rather than a single-judge process.

**Seeing Through the Brain: New Insights from Decoding Visual Stimuli with fMRI**  
*ICLR 2026*  
Zheng Huang, **Enpei Zhang**, Yinghao Cai, Weikang Qiu, Carl Yang, Elynn Chen, Xiang Zhang, Rex Ying, Dawei Zhou, Yujun Yan  
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16196)

Demonstrates that fMRI signals align better with structured text representations than vision model representation; and proposes PRISM, a text-based framework that improves fmri-to-image reconstruction via object-centric diffusion.
